# Dataset Notes

Use this file to capture your observations and questions about `data/books.csv`.

You can note things like:

- A list of the main columns and what you think they mean.
- Which columns are numeric, which are text, and which look like dates.
- Which columns seem most relevant for popularity and reader satisfaction.
- Any confusing columns or values you want to investigate later.

These notes will be useful for later phases when you design the database schema, do EDA, and define cleaning rules.
