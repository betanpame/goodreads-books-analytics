# Repository Notes

This file is a simple place to keep your personal notes about the project structure.

Some prompts you can answer here:

- What is each top-level folder for (for example, `data/`, `plan/`, `src/`, `tests/`)?
- Where do you plan to store notebooks, SQL scripts, and Docker files?
- Are there any files or folders that you do not understand yet?

You can update this file as you progress through the phases.
