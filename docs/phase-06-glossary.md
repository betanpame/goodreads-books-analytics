# Phase 06 – Documentation & Storytelling Glossary

Use this glossary alongside `docs/phase6-step1-task1-notes.md` while preparing portfolio-ready documentation. Every term below anchors the narrative for organizing notebooks, scripts, and artifacts.

- **Analysis script inventory** – The curated table in `docs/phase6-step1-task1-notes.md` that lists each analysis-oriented Python file, where it lives, and why it matters. Treat it as the source of truth before renaming or archiving scripts.
- **Portfolio asset table** – The section in the same note (and future Step 01 tasks) that connects scripts to their downstream artifacts (CSV, PNG, PPTX). Recruiters rely on this to understand the storytelling stack without running code.
- **Legacy CLI** – Any script flagged as "Legacy" or "Obsolete" in the inventory (for example, `tmp/column_summary.py`). These live outside `src/analyses/` and should be archived or deleted once their modern replacements are confirmed.
- **Storytelling stack** – The bundle of modules (`src/analyses/portfolio/p04_sql_vs_pandas_compare.py`, `src/analyses/support/storytelling/plot_comparison_summary.py`, `src/analyses/support/storytelling/export_phase05_slide.py`) plus the PowerShell wrapper that recreate the SQL vs pandas narrative end-to-end. Mention this term whenever you describe deliverables in README or interviews.
- **Inventory manifest** – The raw output file `tmp/phase06_step01_task01_pyfiles.txt` generated by the PowerShell command. Keep it under version control (or regenerate on demand) so future reviewers can diff how the script list evolved.
- **Phase 06 Q&A bridge** – The new FAQ entries in `docs/data-faq.md` that tell teammates how to rerun the inventory and where to find the glossary. Link to them inside README sections when referencing documentation best practices.
- **Portfolio spine** – The numbered set of flagship scripts under `src/analyses/portfolio/` (`01_…` through `04_…`). They are executed sequentially to recreate the full story for hiring managers.
- **Support bench** – The collection of helper CLIs inside `src/analyses/support/` (subfolders `validation/`, `storytelling/`, `documentation/`). These scripts backstop the spine with schema checks, chart exports, and markdown generators.
- **Archive bucket** – The `src/analyses/archive/` directory reserved for deprecated or experimental scripts (e.g., `column_summary_experiment.py`). Keeping them here preserves history without confusing recruiters.
