# Step 04 – Summarize Insights and Draft Storyline

In this step you will synthesize your analysis into a **clear narrative** that could be used in a portfolio, blog post, or presentation.

You will:

- Write a concise summary of the main findings.
- Connect each visualization and metric back to a business question.
- Draft a potential structure for a final case study or README section.

Work through the tasks in the `tasks/` folder in order.
