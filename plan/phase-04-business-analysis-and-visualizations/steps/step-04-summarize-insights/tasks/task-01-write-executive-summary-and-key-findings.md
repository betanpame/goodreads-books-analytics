## Task 01 – Write Executive Summary and Key Findings

### Objective

Create a **concise, non-technical summary** of the most important insights from your analysis that could be used at the top of a case study or README.

### Inputs

- Completed metrics and visualizations from Steps 02 and 03.
- Personal notes taken during EDA and analysis.

### Outputs / Deliverables

- A 3–6 paragraph executive summary in markdown (either in the main notebook or in a separate file like `docs/summary-phase-04.md`).
- A bullet list of 5–10 key findings, each linked to specific charts/metrics.

### Suggested Steps

1. **Identify the main story**

   - Ask yourself: if you could only share 3 insights from this project, what would they be?
   - Note how they connect to business questions (e.g., what makes a successful book on Goodreads?).

2. **Draft the executive summary**

   - Write 1 short paragraph for context (what dataset, what you did).
   - Write 2–4 paragraphs describing the main patterns and what they mean.
   - Keep the tone clear and professional—imagine a stakeholder reading it.

3. **List key findings with references**

   - Create bullet points like:
     - "Books with more than X pages tend to have Y% higher average rating (Figure 3)."
     - "Authors A and B consistently outperform others in both rating and engagement (Table 2)."
   - Mention the chart or table name/number next to each finding.

4. **Refine for clarity**
   - Re-read your summary and bullets.
   - Remove jargon where possible and shorten long sentences.
   - Ensure each finding is supported by at least one metric or chart.

### Checklist

- [ ] 3–6 paragraph executive summary drafted.
- [ ] 5–10 key findings written as bullet points.
- [ ] Each finding references at least one chart or table.
- [ ] Text reviewed and simplified for a non-technical reader.
