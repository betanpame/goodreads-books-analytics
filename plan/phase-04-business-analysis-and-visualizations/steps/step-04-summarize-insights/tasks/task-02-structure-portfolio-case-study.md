## Task 02 – Structure Portfolio Case Study

### Objective

Design a **case study structure** that you can use in your portfolio or as a blog post based on this project.

### Inputs

- Executive summary and key findings from Task 01.
- Notebooks, figures, and notes from all previous phases.

### Outputs / Deliverables

- An outline for a case study document (could be `docs/case-study-outline.md`).
- A mapping from case study sections to project assets (notebooks, figures, SQL scripts).

### Suggested Steps

1. **Draft high-level sections**

   - Suggested structure (adapt as needed):
     - Introduction & Context
     - Dataset Description
     - Problem / Business Questions
     - Methodology (EDA, cleaning, metrics)
     - Key Insights & Visualizations
     - Limitations & Next Steps.

2. **Create a bullet outline**

   - Under each section, add 3–5 bullet points describing what you would explain.
   - Include references to specific notebooks and figures where appropriate.

3. **Link to project artifacts**

   - For each major section, note which assets you would show:
     - EDA notebook (`01_eda_books.ipynb`)
     - Analysis notebook (`02_analysis_and_visualizations.ipynb`)
     - Saved figures (e.g., `figures/top_authors_by_rating.png`).

4. **Identify gaps for future improvement**
   - Add a small "Next Steps" bullet list:
     - Ideas for deeper analysis or more advanced modeling.
     - Potential dashboard or app extensions.
     - Additional data you would like to have.

### Checklist

- [ ] Case study outline file created.
- [ ] High-level sections and bullets defined.
- [ ] Mapping from sections to project assets written.
- [ ] Next-steps ideas listed.
