# Step 02 – Define and Compute Key Business Metrics

In this step you will translate high-level business questions about the Goodreads books catalog into **concrete, computable metrics**, and then implement them using pandas (and optionally SQL).

You will:

- Define a list of core business questions.
- Map each question to 1–3 specific metrics.
- Implement reusable functions that compute these metrics from the cleaned books dataset.
- Produce small summary tables that can be reused in visualizations and later SQL analysis.

Work through the tasks in the `tasks/` folder in order.
