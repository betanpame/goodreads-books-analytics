## Task 01 – Design Visualization Plan

### Objective

Plan a **set of 5–8 visualizations** that directly answer your business questions and make good use of the metrics and summary tables you created.

### Inputs

- Business questions and metrics from Step 02.
- Summary tables such as `df_top_authors`, `df_top_books`, `df_ratings_by_year`, etc.

### Outputs / Deliverables

- A markdown table or bullet list describing each planned chart.
- For each chart: question, dataset, chart type, and key design notes.

### Suggested Steps

1. **List candidate charts**

   - For each business question, brainstorm 1–2 ways to visualize it.
   - Example chart types: bar chart, line chart, scatter plot, boxplot, heatmap.

2. **Map metrics to chart types**

   - Example mappings:
     - Top authors by rating → horizontal bar chart.
     - Ratings over publication years → line chart with confidence band.
     - Num pages vs rating → scatter plot with trend line.
     - Language or publisher comparison → bar or boxplot.

3. **Create a visualization plan table**

   - Columns could include:
     - `Question`
     - `Dataset / Table`
     - `Chart type`
     - `X axis`
     - `Y axis`
     - `Filters / Notes` (e.g., top 20 only, min ratings_count).

4. **Prioritize 5–8 charts**
   - Mark the most important charts (must-have).
   - Keep some ideas as optional extras for later.

### Checklist

- [ ] Candidate charts listed for each business question.
- [ ] Metrics mapped to specific chart types.
- [ ] Visualization plan table created.
- [ ] 5–8 priority charts selected.
