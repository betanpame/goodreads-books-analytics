# Step 03 – Build Insightful Visualizations

In this step you will transform the metrics and intermediate tables into **clear, publication-ready visualizations**.

You will:

- Select the right chart types for each business question.
- Implement 5–8 visualizations using matplotlib/seaborn (or similar libraries).
- Apply good visualization practices: titles, labels, annotations, and consistent styles.

Work through the tasks in the `tasks/` folder in order.
