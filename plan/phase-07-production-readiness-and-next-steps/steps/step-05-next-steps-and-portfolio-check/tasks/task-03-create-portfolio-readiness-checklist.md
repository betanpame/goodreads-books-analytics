## Task 03 – Create Portfolio Readiness Checklist

### Objective

     - Notebooks and code quality.
     - SQL scripts and database.
     - Data pipeline and tests.
     - Visualizations and figures.

2. **Create checklist items under each area**

     - "[ ] Project overview clear and up-to-date".
     - "[ ] Setup and run instructions tested".
   - Under notebooks:
     - "[ ] Key notebooks run from top to bottom without errors".

3. **Add a final overall check**
