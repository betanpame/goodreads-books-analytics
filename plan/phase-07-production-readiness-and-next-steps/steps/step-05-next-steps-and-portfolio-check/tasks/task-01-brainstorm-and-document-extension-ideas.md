## Task 01 – Brainstorm and Document Extension Ideas

### Objective

Identify **future extensions** that could make the project richer and show long-term thinking.

### Outputs

- A list of extension ideas in `docs/next-steps-ideas.md` or merged into `docs/next-steps.md`.

### Steps

1. **Review current capabilities and gaps**

   - Consider what is already implemented (EDA, cleaning, SQL, documentation).
   - Identify missing pieces (e.g., recommendation system, dashboards, more granular data).

2. **Brainstorm ideas across several categories**

   - Analysis & modeling (e.g., predicting book ratings, clustering authors).
   - Data engineering (e.g., incremental updates, handling larger datasets).
   - Product & UX (e.g., interactive dashboards, web apps, reports).
   - Infrastructure (e.g., cloud deployment, CI/CD).

3. **Write each idea as a bullet with details**

   - For each idea, include:
     - A descriptive title.
     - 2–4 sentences explaining the concept and value.

4. **Mark promising ideas**
   - Highlight 2–3 ideas that would be especially strong for your portfolio or learning goals.

### Checklist

- [ ] Extension ideas brainstormed across multiple categories.
- [ ] Ideas written with titles and descriptions.
- [ ] 2–3 promising ideas highlighted as priorities.
