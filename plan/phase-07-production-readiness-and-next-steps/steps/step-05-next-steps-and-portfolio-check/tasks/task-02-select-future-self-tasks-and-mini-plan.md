## Task 02 – Select "Future Self" Tasks and Write Mini Plan

### Objective

Choose a small number of **high-impact next tasks** and outline how you would approach them in a future iteration.

### Outputs

- A `docs/next-sprint-plan.md` file describing 1–2 concrete future tasks and mini implementation plans.

### Steps

1. **Select 1–2 tasks from the backlog**

   - Choose tasks that are:
     - Feasible within a few days of work.
     - Impressive from a portfolio perspective.
     - Personally interesting.

2. **Describe each chosen task in more detail**

   - For each task, write:
     - Goal.
     - Approach/steps.
     - Dependencies (e.g., additional data, libraries).
     - Expected output/deliverables.

3. **Estimate effort and risks**

   - Roughly estimate how much time it might take and what potential blockers exist.

4. **Order tasks**
   - Decide which task you would tackle first and why.

### Checklist

- [ ] 1–2 future tasks chosen from the backlog.
