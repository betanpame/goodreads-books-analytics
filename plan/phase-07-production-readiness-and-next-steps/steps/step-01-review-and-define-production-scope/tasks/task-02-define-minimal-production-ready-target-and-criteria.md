## Task 02 – Define Minimal Production-Ready Target and Criteria

### Objective

Decide what "**production-ready**" means for this portfolio project and define clear, realistic acceptance criteria.

### Outputs

- A `docs/phase-07-goals.md` document describing your target and criteria.

### Steps

1. **Choose a production-readiness focus**

   - Examples:
     - A reproducible end-to-end pipeline (from raw CSV to cleaned tables and key analyses).
     - An "analytics-ready" PostgreSQL database plus SQL analysis scripts.
     - A small CLI or script that others can run to reproduce core results.

2. **Write a short description of the target**

   - In 1–2 paragraphs, explain what your chosen target looks like in practice.
   - Focus on what a new user should be able to do easily.

3. **Define 3–5 acceptance criteria**

   - Examples:
     - "A new user can run one script to load and clean the data."
     - "Core data quality checks run and report status."
     - "Main analysis analysis scripts run with minimal configuration."
     - "SQL queries for key metrics can be executed without editing code."

4. **Prioritize criteria**
   - Mark which criteria are essential for this phase and which are nice-to-have.

### Checklist

- [ ] Production-readiness focus chosen and written down.
- [ ] Target described in 1–2 paragraphs.
- [ ] 3–5 acceptance criteria defined.
- [ ] Criteria prioritized (must-have vs nice-to-have).
