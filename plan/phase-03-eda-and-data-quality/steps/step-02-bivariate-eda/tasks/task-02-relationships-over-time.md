# Task 02 – Relationships Over Time

## Objective

Explore how book-related metrics behave over publication time.

## Instructions

1. Ensure that `publication_date` is parsed as a datetime column, and derive:
   - `publication_year` as a new column.
2. Analyze:
   - Number of books published per year.
   - Average `average_rating` by publication year.
   - (Optional) Average `ratings_count` by publication year.
3. Create line plots or bar charts to visualize trends over years.
4. In markdown, discuss:
   - Are there particular periods with more books?
   - Do more recent books tend to have different rating patterns?
   - Any caveats (e.g., recency bias in ratings, incomplete older data).

## Checklist

- [ ] I have created a `publication_year` feature.
- [ ] I have plotted number of books by year.
- [ ] I have plotted average rating (and optionally rating count) by year.
- [ ] I have written interpretations of temporal trends.

## Result

You understand basic temporal patterns in the dataset, which will be useful for trend-related analyses.
