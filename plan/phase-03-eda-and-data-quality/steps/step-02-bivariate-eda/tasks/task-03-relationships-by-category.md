# Task 03 – Relationships by Category

## Objective

Analyze how ratings and popularity vary across categories such as language, author, and publisher.

## Instructions

1. Choose at least two categorical fields to analyze, such as:
   - `language_code`
   - `publisher`
   - `authors` (possibly focusing on top authors).
2. For each chosen category:
   - Filter to the top N categories by count (e.g., top 10 languages or publishers).
   - Compute aggregated metrics per category:
     - Average `average_rating`.
     - Median `ratings_count`.
     - Number of books.
3. Create bar charts or boxplots to compare categories.
4. Document in markdown:
   - Which languages, publishers, or authors appear strongest by rating.
   - Any patterns in engagement (ratings_count, text_reviews_count).

## Checklist

- [ ] I have selected at least two categorical dimensions to analyze.
- [ ] I have computed aggregated metrics by category.
- [ ] I have created visualizations comparing categories.
- [ ] I have summarized key differences and possible explanations.

## Result

You have insight into how ratings and popularity differ by category (language, publisher, authors), setting up richer business analysis later.
