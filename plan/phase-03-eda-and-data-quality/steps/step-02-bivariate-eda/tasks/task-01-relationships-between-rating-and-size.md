# Task 01 – Relationships Between Rating and Size

## Objective

Examine how book size and popularity relate to reader ratings.

## Instructions

1. Focus on relationships involving `average_rating` and:
   - `num_pages`
   - `ratings_count`
   - `text_reviews_count`
2. Create scatter plots (or scatter plots with transparency) to visualize:
   - `num_pages` vs `average_rating`.
   - `ratings_count` vs `average_rating` (consider log scale for `ratings_count`).
3. Optionally, use binning techniques:
   - Group books by page count buckets (e.g., 0–200, 200–400, 400–600, etc.).
   - Compute average rating per bucket and plot as a bar chart or line plot.
4. Interpret findings in markdown cells:
   - Do longer books tend to have higher ratings?
   - Do more-rated books have higher or lower average ratings?

## Checklist

- [ ] I have created scatter plots or equivalent visualizations for rating vs. size/popularity metrics.
- [ ] I have experimented with log scales or binning when appropriate.
- [ ] I have written interpretations connecting these relationships to potential business questions.

## Result

You have initial insights into how book length and popularity are associated with reader ratings.
