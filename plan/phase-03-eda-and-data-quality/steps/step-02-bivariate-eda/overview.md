# Step 02 – Bivariate and Relationship Analysis

## Goal

Explore relationships between pairs of variables (for example, rating vs. number of pages) to prepare for business analysis.

## Why This Step Matters

Bivariate analysis helps you:
- See how two variables interact.
- Generate hypotheses about what drives high ratings or popularity.
- Decide which relationships are worth exploring more deeply in later phases.

## Tasks

Detailed tasks are in the `tasks/` folder:

1. `task-01-relationships-between-rating-and-size.md`
2. `task-02-relationships-over-time.md`
3. `task-03-relationships-by-category.md`
