# Step 03 – Data Quality Assessment and Cleaning Rules

## Goal

Systematically evaluate data quality and define clear, documented rules for cleaning and preparing the dataset.

## Why This Step Matters

Good data quality is essential for trustworthy analysis. This step ensures you:
- Know where the data is incomplete or inconsistent.
- Decide how to handle missing values and outliers.
- Document cleaning rules that you will later implement in code.

## Tasks

Detailed tasks are in the `tasks/` folder:

1. `task-01-assess-missing-values-and-duplicates.md`
2. `task-02-detect-outliers-and-inconsistencies.md`
3. `task-03-define-and-document-cleaning-rules.md`
