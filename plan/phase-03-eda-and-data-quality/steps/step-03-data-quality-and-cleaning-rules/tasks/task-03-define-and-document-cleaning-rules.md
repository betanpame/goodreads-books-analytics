# Task 03 – Define and Document Cleaning Rules

## Objective

Translate your EDA and data quality findings into a clear, documented set of cleaning rules.

## Instructions

1. Create a markdown file dedicated to cleaning rules, for example `docs/data-cleaning-rules.md`.
2. For each type of issue you discovered (missing values, duplicates, outliers, inconsistent dates, etc.), define:
   - **Description of the issue**.
   - **Columns affected**.
   - **Rule/Decision** (e.g., drop rows, impute values, cap outliers, ignore).
   - **Rationale** (why this decision is reasonable for analysis).
3. Prioritize rules that you will implement soon in Phase 04 (data cleaning in Python).
4. Optionally, tag rules as:
   - "Must-do now".
   - "Nice-to-have later".
5. Add a short summary in your EDA notebook pointing to this markdown file.

## Checklist

- [ ] I have created `docs/data-cleaning-rules.md` (or similar).
- [ ] I have written specific rules for handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
- [ ] I have explained the rationale behind each rule.
- [ ] I have linked or referenced this file from my EDA notebook.

## Result

You have a professional, well-documented set of data cleaning rules ready to implement in later phases, improving both learning and portfolio quality.
