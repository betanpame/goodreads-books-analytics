# Step 01 – Univariate EDA (Distributions)

## Goal

Analyze the distribution of individual variables (one at a time) in the Goodreads Books dataset.

## Why This Step Matters

Univariate analysis helps you:
- Understand typical ranges and shapes (e.g., skewness) of key metrics.
- Identify outliers and extreme values.
- Spot potential data entry or ingestion issues.

## Tasks

Detailed tasks are in the `tasks/` folder:

2. `task-02-explore-numeric-distributions.md`
3. `task-03-explore-categorical-distributions.md`
