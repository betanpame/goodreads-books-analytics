# Task 02 – Explore Numeric Distributions

## Objective

Analyze the distributions of key numeric columns using summary statistics and visualizations.

## Instructions

1. Identify key numeric columns, such as:
   - `average_rating`
   - `num_pages`
   - `ratings_count`
   - `text_reviews_count`
2. For each column:
   - Compute basic statistics: mean, median, min, max, standard deviation.
   - Plot a histogram and/or kernel density estimate (KDE).
   - Consider using log scale for heavily skewed variables (e.g., `ratings_count`).
3. In module docstring or Markdown notes, interpret what you see:
   - Are distributions symmetric or skewed?
   - Are there extreme values that might be outliers?
   - What does the distribution suggest about reader behavior or book characteristics?

## Checklist

- [ ] I have computed summary statistics for key numeric columns.
- [ ] I have created histograms/KDE plots for each numeric column.
- [ ] I have written short interpretations for each variable.

## Result

You have a clear understanding of how numeric variables are distributed, which helps identify outliers and inform later business analysis.
