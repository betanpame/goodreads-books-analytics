# Step 03 – Implement and Test Docker Setup

## Goal

Implement the Docker configuration for the Python CLI environment and verify that it runs correctly and can see the project files.

## Why This Step Matters

This is where your design from Step 02 becomes real. By the end of this step, you should be able to:

- Build and run the Python CLI Docker image.
- Execute Python scripts from inside the running container.
- Access the `goodreads-books-analytics` project files from within the container.

## Tasks

Detailed tasks are in the `tasks/` folder:

1. `task-01-create-dockerfile-and-build-image.md`
2. `task-02-run-container-and-test-cli.md`
3. `task-03-mount-project-folder-and-verify-access.md`
