# Task 02 – Run Container and Open Jupyter

## Objective

Run the Python + Jupyter Docker container and confirm that you can access Jupyter in your browser.

## Instructions

1. Start a container from the image you built in Task 01.
2. Expose the Jupyter port (commonly `8888`) to your host machine.
3. Ensure that the container starts Jupyter automatically, or run Jupyter manually inside the container.
4. Open your browser and navigate to the Jupyter URL (often `http://localhost:8888`).
5. Confirm that you see the Jupyter interface.

## Checklist

- [ ] I have started a container from my Python image.
- [ ] The Jupyter server is running inside the container.
- [ ] I can open Jupyter in my browser from the host machine.

## Result

You have verified that Jupyter works inside your Docker container and is accessible from your machine.
