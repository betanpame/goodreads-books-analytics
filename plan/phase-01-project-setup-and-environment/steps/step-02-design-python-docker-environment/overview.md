# Step 02 – Design Python CLI Docker Environment

## Goal

Design a simple but robust **Docker-based Python environment** that will be used for all analysis scripts and analysis work in this project.

## Why This Step Matters

A well-designed Docker environment prevents "it works on my machine" problems and makes it easy to:

- Reproduce your work later.
- Share the project with others.
- Deploy the environment to the cloud in the future.

## Tasks

Detailed tasks are in the `tasks/` folder:

1. `task-01-define-python-environment-requirements.md`
2. `task-02-draft-dockerfile-for-cli-environment.md`
3. `task-03-plan-docker-compose-structure.md`

Complete these tasks before you start actually building and running containers (that happens in Step 03).
