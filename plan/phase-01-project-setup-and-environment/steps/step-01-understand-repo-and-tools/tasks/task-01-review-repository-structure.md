# Task 01 – Review Repository Structure

## Objective

Understand the main folders and files in the `goodreads-books-analytics` repository.

## Instructions

1. Open the repository in VS Code.
2. Explore the top-level folders and files:
   - `data/`
   - `docs/` (if present)
   - `plan/` (this planning folder)
   - `README.md`
3. For each folder, write a short note (in your own notes or a markdown file) describing:
   - What the folder is for.
   - What you expect to store there later (e.g., notebooks, SQL scripts, Docker files).
4. Open `data/books.csv` and look at the first ~30–50 lines just to get a feel for the columns and data types.

## Checklist

- [ ] I have opened the repository in VS Code.
- [ ] I have reviewed all top-level folders and files.
- [ ] I have written short notes describing the purpose of each folder.
- [ ] I have briefly inspected `data/books.csv`.

## Result

You should now have a mental map of the project structure and a first impression of the dataset.
