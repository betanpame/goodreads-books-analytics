# Task 02 – Examine Dataset Preview

## Objective

Get a slightly deeper understanding of the Goodreads Books dataset before setting up the full environment.

## Instructions

1. Open `data/books.csv` in VS Code or in a spreadsheet tool (such as Excel or LibreOffice Calc) so that you can easily see the column names.
2. Identify the key columns in `books.csv`, such as:
   - `bookID`
   - `title`
   - `authors`
   - `average_rating`
   - `num_pages`
   - `ratings_count`
   - `text_reviews_count`
   - `publication_date`
   - `publisher`
3. In `docs/dataset-notes.md`, answer these questions:
   - Which columns look numeric? Which are text? Which represent dates?
   - Which columns seem most relevant for understanding **book popularity** and **reader satisfaction**?
   - Are there any columns that you do not understand yet? List them.

## Checklist

- [ ] I have listed the main columns and their data types (roughly) in `docs/dataset-notes.md`.
- [ ] I have identified which columns are most relevant for analysis.
- [ ] I have written down at least 2–3 questions or hypotheses about the data in `docs/dataset-notes.md`.

## Result

You should now have initial hypotheses about what the data can tell you and which columns are important for later analysis, all recorded in `docs/dataset-notes.md` so that you can refer back to them.
