# Step 01 – Understand Repository and Tools

## Goal

Familiarize yourself with the project repository, the dataset, and the main tools you will use (VS Code, Git, Docker, Jupyter, PostgreSQL).

## Why This Step Matters

Before writing any code or configuring Docker, you should clearly understand:
- What files and folders already exist.
- Where the dataset lives and what it looks like.
- Which tools you will use throughout the project.

This reduces confusion later and helps you make better design decisions.

## Tasks

The detailed tasks for this step are in the `tasks/` folder:

1. `task-01-review-repository-structure.md`
2. `task-02-examine-dataset-preview.md`
3. `task-03-verify-tools-installation.md`

Complete these tasks in order and check off each item as you finish it.
