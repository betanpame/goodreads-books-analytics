# Task 02 – Draft summary narrative or slide outline

## Objective

Create a first draft of the story you want to tell (in text or slide format), connecting problem, approach, and results.

## Steps

- [ ] Choose the primary format: markdown document, presentation (PowerPoint/Google Slides), or other.
- [ ] Based on Task 01, define a basic structure, for example:
  - Context and business problem.
  - Dataset and analysis approach.
  - 2–3 key results sections (one per group of questions).
  - Recommendations and possible next steps.
- [ ] For each section, write bullets or short sentences that you can later expand.
- [ ] Check that the narrative has a beginning (context), middle (analysis and findings), and end (recommendations).

## Expected outcome

A first draft of the narrative or slide outline, clear enough to present to a business stakeholder or use in an interview.
