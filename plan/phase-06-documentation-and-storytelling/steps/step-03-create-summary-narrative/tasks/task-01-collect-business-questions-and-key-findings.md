# Task 01 – Collect business questions and key findings

## Objective

Bring together in one place the main business questions and the most important findings you want to highlight in your narrative or presentation.

## Steps

- [ ] Review the general plan (`plan/plan.md`) and the overviews of Phases 03, 04, and 05 to recall the guiding questions.
- [ ] Make a list of the **business questions** you actually addressed (for example: characteristics of highly rated books, standout authors, etc.).
- [ ] For each question, briefly note:
  - The approach used (EDA, simple model, SQL queries, etc.).
  - 1–2 key findings.
  - Links to analysis scripts or queries where the result is shown.
- [ ] Save this table/list in a markdown file (for example `docs/story-questions-and-findings.md`).

## Expected outcome

A structured summary of questions and insights that will be the direct basis for writing the narrative or slides.
