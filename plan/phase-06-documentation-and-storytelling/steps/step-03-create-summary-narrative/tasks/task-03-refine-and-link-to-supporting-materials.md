# Task 03 – Refine narrative and link supporting materials

## Objective

Polish the narrative or presentation and make sure every claim is supported by analysis scripts, figures, or SQL queries.

## Steps

- [ ] Review the draft and simplify language where needed, avoiding jargon.
- [ ] Ensure each key finding has:
  - A reference to the corresponding visualization or table.
  - A clear link or indication of where to find more detail (analysis script, SQL script, etc.).
- [ ] Include 2–3 screenshots or key charts if you are using slides or a document with images.
- [ ] Save the final version (for example under `docs/summary_narrative.md` or in a `docs/slides/` folder).

## Expected outcome

A refined narrative or presentation, connected to the rest of the repository and ready to share with others.
