# Phase 06 – Step 03: Create Summary Narrative or Slides

## Goal

Create a **short narrative or presentation** (slides or document) that summarizes the business questions, approach, and main conclusions of the project.

This step aligns with Phase 06 by focusing on the **story** behind the analyses: what problem you wanted to solve, what you did, and what you recommend.

## What you will do in this step

- Identify the main **business questions** covered in previous phases.
- Summarize the **methodological approach** (EDA, cleaning, Python analysis, SQL, etc.).
- Select the **key visualizations and results** that best support your conclusions.
- Draft a short narrative that connects:
  - Problem / context.
  - Approach and data.
  - Findings.
  - Recommendations or next steps.
- Decide the format: markdown document, Google Slides, PowerPoint, PDF, etc., and document where it lives in the repo (for example under `docs/`).

## Expected outcome

By the end of this step you should have:

- A **written summary** (and optionally slides) that tells the story of the project end to end.
- Clear references to the visualizations/notebooks where each point is explored in more depth.
- An asset ready to use in interviews or presentations.

Detailed tasks are in the `tasks/` folder for this step.
