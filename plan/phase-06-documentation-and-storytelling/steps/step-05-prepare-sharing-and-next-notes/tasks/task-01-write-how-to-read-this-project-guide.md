## Task 01 – "How to Read This Project" guide

### Objective

Give new visitors a **short navigation guide** so they know where to start and how to explore the repository efficiently.

### Outputs

- A short guide in `docs/how-to-read-this-project.md` or as a section inside `README.md`.

### Steps

1. **Define reader profiles**

   - Think of 2–3 types of readers, for example:
     - Recruiter with limited time (2–3 minutes).
     - Technical peer (10–20 minutes).
     - Future you (longer deep dive).

2. **Write quick paths for each profile**

   - For each profile, list 3–5 bullets indicating:
     - Which README sections to read.
     - Which notebook(s) to open.
     - Which figures or SQL files to review, if applicable.

3. **Mention estimated time and effort**

   - Example: "If you have 5 minutes, read the Project Overview and Key Insights sections in the README."
   - "If you have 30 minutes, run `02_analysis_and_visualizations.ipynb` end to end."

4. **Place the guide in the repo**
   - Keep it as `docs/how-to-read-this-project.md` or as a clear section inside the README, but always make sure it is linked from the README.

### Checklist

- [ ] Reader profiles defined.
- [ ] Navigation bullets written for each profile.
- [ ] File created and/or linked from the README.
- [ ] Guide is short, clear, and actionable.
