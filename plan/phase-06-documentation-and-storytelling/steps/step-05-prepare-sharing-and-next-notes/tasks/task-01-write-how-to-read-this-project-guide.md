## Task 01 – Write "How to Read This Project" Guide

### Objective

Give new readers a **short navigation guide** so they know where to start and how to explore your work efficiently.

### Outputs

- A short guide in `docs/how-to-read-this-project.md` or a README section.

### Steps

1. **Define reader profiles**

   - Think of 2–3 types of readers:
     - Busy recruiter (2–3 minutes).
     - Technical peer (10–20 minutes).
     - You in the future (deep dive).

2. **Write quick paths for each profile**

   - For each profile, list 3–5 bullets:
     - Which sections of README to read.
     - Which notebook(s) to open.
     - Which figures or SQL files to look at.

3. **Mention estimated time and effort**

   - Example: "If you have 5 minutes, read the Project Overview and Key Insights sections in the README."
   - "If you have 30 minutes, run `03_analysis_and_visualizations.ipynb` end-to-end."

4. **Place the guide**
   - Either keep it as a separate `docs/how-to-read-this-project.md` file or link it clearly from README.

### Checklist

- [ ] Reader profiles defined.
- [ ] Navigation bullets written for each profile.
- [ ] File created and/or linked from README.
- [ ] Guide is short, clear, and actionable.
