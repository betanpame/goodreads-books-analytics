## Task 02 – Write Learning Reflections

### Objective

Capture what **you personally learned** from the project in a way that you can reuse in interviews and future projects.

### Outputs

- A `docs/learning-notes.md` file with short reflection sections.

### Steps

1. **Create reflection sections**

   - Suggested headings:
     - What I learned about data analysis.
     - What I learned about SQL and databases.
     - What I learned about documentation and storytelling.
     - What I would do differently next time.

2. **Write short paragraphs under each heading**

   - Keep it personal and concrete ("I learned how to use window functions to rank books per author" instead of generalities).

3. **Add 1–2 bullet points per section for interview talking points**

   - For each heading, add bullets like:
     - "Example: debugging a mismatch between pandas and SQL results."
     - "Example: designing a cleaning pipeline that balances strictness and data retention."

4. **Review and keep it honest**
   - This document is mainly for you; clarity and honesty are more important than polish.

### Checklist

- [ ] `docs/learning-notes.md` created.
- [ ] Reflection paragraphs written for each heading.
- [ ] 1–2 talking-point bullets per section added.
- [ ] Content reviewed and feels authentic.
