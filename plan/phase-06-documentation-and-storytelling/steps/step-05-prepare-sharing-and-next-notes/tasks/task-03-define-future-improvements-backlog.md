## Task 03 – Define future improvements backlog

### Objective

Create a small **prioritized backlog of future improvements** that shows you are thinking beyond the current project scope.

### Outputs

- A `docs/next-steps.md` file listing potential improvements and extensions.

### Steps

1. **Brainstorm improvement ideas**

   - Consider areas such as:
     - More advanced modeling (e.g., predicting ratings or recommending books).
     - Additional data sources (user reviews, explicit genres, external ratings).
     - Dashboards or apps (Streamlit, Power BI, Tableau).
     - Automation (scheduled jobs, CI/CD for the data pipeline).

2. **Write the backlog list**

   - For each idea, include:
     - A short title.
     - 1–3 sentences describing what you would do.
     - Why it would add value (for users or for your learning).

3. **Assign rough priority and effort**

   - For each item, add:
     - Priority (High / Medium / Low).
     - Effort estimate (Small / Medium / Large).

4. **Highlight 2–3 most promising items**
   - Mark them as "likely next steps" for your future self.

### Checklist

- [ ] `docs/next-steps.md` created.
