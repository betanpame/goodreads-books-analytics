## Task 03 – Define Future Improvements Backlog

### Objective

Create a small, prioritized **backlog of future improvements** that shows you think beyond the current scope.

### Outputs

- A `docs/next-steps.md` file listing potential future enhancements.

### Steps

1. **Brainstorm improvement ideas**

   - Consider areas such as:
     - More advanced modeling (e.g., predicting ratings, recommending books).
     - Additional data sources (e.g., user reviews, genres, external ratings).
     - Dashboards or apps (Streamlit, Power BI, Tableau).
     - Automation (scheduled jobs, CI/CD for data pipeline).

2. **Write a backlog list**

   - For each idea, include:
     - A short title.
     - 1–3 sentences describing what you would do.
     - Why it would add value (for users or for your learning).

3. **Assign rough priority and effort**

   - For each item, add:
     - Priority (High / Medium / Low).
     - Effort estimate (Small / Medium / Large).

4. **Highlight 2–3 most promising items**
   - Mark a few items as "next likely steps" for your future self.
