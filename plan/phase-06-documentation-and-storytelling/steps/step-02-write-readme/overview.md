# Phase 06 – Step 02: Write and Polish README

## Goal

Write and polish the **main repository README** so that it tells the project story in a clear, professional way that is accessible to non-technical readers.

This step aligns with Phase 06 by turning technical work into an understandable narrative. Here you bring together context, motivation, dataset, architecture, and a summary of results into a single central document.

## What you will do in this step

- Define the structure of `README.md` (main sections and order).
- Draft:
  - Project description and motivation.
  - Dataset description (`data/books.csv`).
  - High-level architecture overview (Python, PostgreSQL, Docker).
  - Basic instructions to run the project locally (and leave room for future cloud deployment).
  - Summary of key findings with references to charts or notebooks.
- Ensure the language is clear, avoiding unnecessary jargon and briefly explaining technical terms.

## Expected outcome

By the end of this step you should have:

- A root `README.md` with clear, complete sections.
- Links from the README to key notebooks, SQL scripts, and other important resources.
- A professional tone oriented toward someone seeing the project for the first time.

Detailed tasks are in the `tasks/` folder for this step.
