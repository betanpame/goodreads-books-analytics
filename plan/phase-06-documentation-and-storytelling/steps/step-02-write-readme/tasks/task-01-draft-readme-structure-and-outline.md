# Task 01 – Draft README structure and outline

## Objective

Create a clear outline for the main `README.md`, defining sections and order before writing the full content.

## Steps

- [ ] Review the Phase 06 overview to recall what the README should cover.
- [ ] Sketch the basic structure in a temporary file (or directly in `README.md` in draft mode), for example:
  - Introduction / project motivation.
  - Dataset description.
  - Architecture and technologies used (Python, PostgreSQL, Docker).
  - How to run the project locally.
  - Summary of key findings with links to src/analyses/figures.
- [ ] Check that the section order tells a logical story for someone who has never seen the project.

## Expected outcome

An agreed section outline for `README.md`, ready to be filled with content in the next tasks.
