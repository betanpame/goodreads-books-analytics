# Task 02 – Write core README content

## Objective

Fill in the main sections of `README.md` with clear, professional text, avoiding unnecessary jargon.

## Steps

- [ ] Write the **introduction and motivation**, explaining what problem you are addressing and why it is interesting.
- [ ] Write the **dataset** section, explaining where `data/books.csv` comes from, what it contains, and any limitations.
- [ ] Describe the **architecture and technologies**: Python/pandas, PostgreSQL, Docker, key analysis scripts and scripts.
- [ ] Add a **how to run the project** section (in its current state), for example:
  - Minimum requirements.
  - Basic commands (with or without Docker, depending on what you already have implemented).
- [ ] Review the text to make sure a non-technical person can understand it.

## Expected outcome

A `README.md` with the main sections written, even if you still need to refine details about results or links.
