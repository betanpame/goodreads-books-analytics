# Task 03 – Add results summary and key links

## Objective

Complete `README.md` with a brief summary of key findings and links to relevant notebooks, SQL queries, and/or figures.

## Steps

- [ ] Identify 2–4 main findings from your analyses (for example: what characterizes highly rated books, patterns by author/publisher, etc.).
- [ ] Write a short **Key results** section in the README:
  - Use simple language.
  - Keep each point to 1–2 sentences.
- [ ] Add links to:
  - Main notebooks (`notebooks/01_eda_books.ipynb`, `02_analysis_and_visualizations.ipynb`, etc.).
  - Relevant SQL scripts if they exist.
  - Images/figures if you export them to `docs/figures/` or another folder.
- [ ] Check that you are not duplicating too much of the narrative or case study from Step 03 (you can point readers there for more detail).

## Expected outcome

A `README.md` that not only explains how to run the project, but also briefly communicates the most important conclusions and guides the reader to key resources.
