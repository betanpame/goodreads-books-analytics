## Task 03 – Write Insights and Business Interpretation Section

### Objective

Translate your quantitative results into **business-relevant insights** that a non-technical stakeholder can understand and act on.

### Outputs

- A "Key Insights" or "Findings" section inside the case study document.

### Steps

1. **Select key findings**

   - Choose 5–10 of the most important findings from your analysis.
   - Ensure each finding answers a clear question (e.g., "Which authors consistently outperform others?").

2. **Write one paragraph per finding**

   - For each finding, explain:
     - What pattern you observed (in plain language).
     - Which metric/chart/table supports it.
     - What it could mean for a stakeholder (publisher, platform, author).

3. **Reference supporting artifacts**

   - After each paragraph, note the relevant artifact in parentheses, e.g.:
     - "(See Figure 2: Top authors by average rating)".
     - "(See Table 3: Ratings and engagement by publication year)".

4. **Avoid technical jargon**

   - Replace technical terms with short explanations when needed (e.g., "correlation" → "tend to increase together").

5. **Check that insights are supported by data**
   - Ensure each claim links back to a concrete result (no speculation without evidence).

### Checklist

- [ ] 5–10 findings selected.
- [ ] Each finding written as a short, clear paragraph.
- [ ] Each finding references at least one chart/table.
- [ ] Language is understandable to non-technical readers.
- [ ] All claims backed by data.
