## Task 01 – Draft Project Overview Section for README

### Objective

Write a clear, concise **Project Overview** that explains what the project is, why it exists, and what value it provides.

### Outputs

- A draft "Project Overview" section in the root `README.md` (or in a temporary file to be merged later).

### Steps

1. **Define the audience and tone**

   - Assume the reader is a **technical recruiter or data leader** with limited time.
   - Aim for clarity and impact in 2–4 short paragraphs.

2. **Describe the problem and dataset**

   - Explain in 2–3 sentences:
     - What the Goodreads books dataset contains (high-level).
     - What questions you want to answer (e.g., what makes books successful, patterns in ratings and engagement).

3. **Summarize the approach**

   - In 1–2 paragraphs, summarize:
     - Using Python/pandas for EDA and cleaning.
     - Using PostgreSQL/SQL for reproducible analysis.
     - Using Docker for reproducible environment.

4. **Highlight key outcomes**

   - Add 3–5 bullet points that mention:
     - The main types of insights discovered.
     - Technical highlights (e.g., window functions, data quality checks).
     - Deliverables (notebooks, SQL scripts, figures, documentation).

5. **Add a short "Who is this for?" note (optional)**
   - One sentence explaining that the project is suitable as a portfolio piece, a learning resource, or a starting point for deeper analysis.

### Checklist

- [ ] Project purpose and dataset described.
- [ ] Approach summarized (Python, SQL, Docker).
