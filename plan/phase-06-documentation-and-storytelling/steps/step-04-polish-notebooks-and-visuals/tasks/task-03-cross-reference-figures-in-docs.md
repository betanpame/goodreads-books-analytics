## Task 03 – Cross-Reference Figures in Documentation

### Objective

Connect your documentation (README, case study) to your exported figures so readers can easily see the visuals that support each insight.

### Outputs

- Updated README and case study with correct figure references and/or embedded images.

### Steps

1. **List all exported figures**

   - From `figures/`, note filenames and what each image shows.
   - Create a small mapping table if helpful: `Filename -> Description -> Related Insight`.

2. **Update case study references**

   - In `docs/case-study-goodreads-books.md` (or similar), ensure each mentioned figure has:
     - The correct filename.
     - A caption or reference number (e.g., "Figure 2").

3. **Update README references**

   - In `README.md`, ensure embedded images or links point to the correct files.
   - Align wording so that figure names and descriptions match between README and the case study.

4. **Check consistency**

   - Make sure you do not reference figures that no longer exist or have been replaced.
   - Remove references to outdated drafts.

5. **Preview docs**
   - Use VS Code or GitHub preview to view README and case study.
   - Confirm that images render correctly and captions make sense.

### Checklist

- [ ] All figures listed with descriptions.
- [ ] Case study updated with accurate figure references.
- [ ] README updated with correct image paths and text.
- [ ] No broken or outdated figure references.
- [ ] Docs previewed and verified.
