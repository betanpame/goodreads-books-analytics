# Task 01 – Review and improve charts

## Objective

Improve the readability and quality of visualizations so they clearly communicate key ideas.

## Steps

- [ ] Identify the most important charts in your notebooks (the ones you will use in the README or narrative).
- [ ] For each key chart, review:
  - Descriptive title (what it shows and why it matters).
  - Clear axis labels, with units where applicable.
  - Legible legends without redundant information.
  - Consistent colors (for example, using the same color for the same category across charts).
- [ ] Adjust figure size, label rotation, etc., so they are easy to read on screen and in screenshots.

## Expected outcome

Key charts that are clearer and more professional, ready to be reused in the README or presentations.
