## Task 01 – Clean and Annotate Notebooks

### Objective

Polish your notebooks so they read like **clear, guided analyses** rather than raw scratch work.

### Outputs

- All key notebooks cleaned, with explanatory markdown and minimal noise.

### Steps

1. **Identify key notebooks**

   - Decide which notebooks you want to show in your portfolio (e.g., EDA, cleaning, analysis, SQL comparison).
   - Focus cleanup efforts on these first.

2. **Add structure with markdown headings**

   - For each notebook, add headings such as:
     - Introduction / Goals.
     - Data Loading.
     - EDA.
     - Cleaning.
     - Analysis & Visualizations.
     - Conclusions.

3. **Explain code blocks**

   - Before each major code cell, add 1–3 sentences explaining what you are about to do and why.
   - Avoid explaining trivial imports, but do explain data transformations and analytical steps.

4. **Remove or minimize noisy cells**

   - Delete cells that are purely debugging or repeated experiments.
   - If some experiments are useful for learning, group them in a separate "Appendix" section.

5. **Ensure notebooks run from top to bottom**

   - Restart the kernel and run all cells to confirm there are no missing dependencies or ordering issues.

6. **Standardize style**
   - Use consistent naming for variables and sections across notebooks.
   - Make sure plots are large enough and labeled.

### Checklist

- [ ] Portfolio notebooks identified.
- [ ] Headings added to structure each notebook.
- [ ] Explanatory markdown added before important code blocks.
- [ ] Debug/noise cells removed or moved to Appendix.
- [ ] Notebooks run cleanly from top to bottom.
- [ ] Style and tone consistent across notebooks.
