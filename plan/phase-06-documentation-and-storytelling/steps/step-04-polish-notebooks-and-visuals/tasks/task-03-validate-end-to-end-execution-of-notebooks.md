# Task 03 – Validate end-to-end execution of notebooks

## Objective

Ensure that key notebooks can be executed from start to finish without errors and in a reasonably short time.

## Steps

- [ ] Choose the main notebooks defined in Phase 06 (for example, 01_eda, 02_analysis, 03_sql_vs_pandas).
- [ ] For each one:
  - [ ] Restart the kernel and run **Run All**.
  - [ ] Check that there are no errors or broken cells.
  - [ ] Adjust if necessary:
    - File paths.
    - Database connection parameters.
    - Random seeds or filters that could break the flow.
- [ ] Note any special prerequisites you discover so you can document them (for example in the README or a notes file).

## Expected outcome

Notebooks that work end to end and that anyone can run by following the project instructions.
