# Task 02 – Add explanatory markdown near key visuals

## Objective

Provide context for each important visualization with a brief explanation in natural language.

## Steps

- [ ] Go through the main analysis scripts and locate key visualizations.
- [ ] Before or after each important chart, add a module docstring or Markdown note that includes:
  - One sentence about what the chart shows.
  - One sentence about the main interpretation or conclusion.
  - Optional: how it connects to the corresponding business question.
- [ ] Avoid repeating long text that already appears in the narrative; short, clear notes are enough here.

## Expected outcome

Analysis Scripts that read like a guided story, where each chart is accompanied by a short, understandable explanation.
