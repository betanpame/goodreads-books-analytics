# Phase 06 – Step 04: Polish Notebooks and Visuals

## Goal

Polish notebooks and visualizations so they are **clear, consistent, and visually appealing**, ready to be shown in a portfolio or presentation.

This step complements the previous ones: once the structure is organized and the narrative is written, here you improve visual and presentation details.

## What you will do in this step

- Review existing charts (titles, axes, legends, colors) and improve them.
- Make sure each visualization clearly answers a question or supports a point in the narrative.
- Add short comments or markdown cells next to charts explaining what they show and why they matter.
- Verify that notebooks run from top to bottom without errors and in a reasonable amount of time.

## Expected outcome

By the end of this step you should have:

- More readable visualizations aligned with the project story.
- Notebooks that read like a step-by-step narrative, not just a collection of technical cells.
- Less visual noise (redundant charts, inconsistent styles, etc.).

Detailed tasks are in the `tasks/` folder for this step.
