# Phase 06 – Step 01: Organize and Clean Analysis Scripts

## Goal

Make all project analysis scripts **clear, organized, and easy to follow** for any new person visiting the repository.

This step aligns with Phase 06, which focuses on turning technical work into a clear, professional story. Here you focus on the **structure and cleanliness of the analysis scripts** before writing the README and storytelling material.

## What you will do in this step

- Locate all existing analysis scripts related to EDA, analysis, SQL vs pandas comparison, etc.
- Define a **folder structure and naming convention** for analysis scripts (for example, `src/analyses/01_eda_books.py`, `02_analysis_and_visualizations.py`, etc.).
- Clean analysis scripts (remove noisy sections, ensure they run from top to bottom, reduce clutter).
- Add or improve module docstring or Markdown notes to explain what each analysis script does and how it relates to the project.

## Expected outcome

By the end of this step you should have:

- A `src/analyses/` folder organized with consistent names and a logical order.
- Analysis Scripts without noise (no irrelevant test sections or duplicated results).
- Short markdown explanations at the top of each analysis script indicating its goal.

Detailed tasks are in the `tasks/` folder for this step.
