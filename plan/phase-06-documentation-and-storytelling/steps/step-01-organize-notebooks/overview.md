# Phase 06 – Step 01: Organize and Clean Notebooks

## Goal

Make all project notebooks **clear, organized, and easy to follow** for any new person visiting the repository.

This step aligns with Phase 06, which focuses on turning technical work into a clear, professional story. Here you focus on the **structure and cleanliness of the notebooks** before writing the README and storytelling material.

## What you will do in this step

- Locate all existing notebooks related to EDA, analysis, SQL vs pandas comparison, etc.
- Define a **folder structure and naming convention** for notebooks (for example, `notebooks/01_eda_books.ipynb`, `02_analysis_and_visualizations.ipynb`, etc.).
- Clean notebooks (remove noisy cells, ensure they run from top to bottom, reduce clutter).
- Add or improve markdown cells to explain what each notebook does and how it relates to the project.

## Expected outcome

By the end of this step you should have:

- A `notebooks/` folder organized with consistent names and a logical order.
- Notebooks without noise (no irrelevant test cells or duplicated results).
- Short markdown explanations at the top of each notebook indicating its goal.

Detailed tasks are in the `tasks/` folder for this step.
