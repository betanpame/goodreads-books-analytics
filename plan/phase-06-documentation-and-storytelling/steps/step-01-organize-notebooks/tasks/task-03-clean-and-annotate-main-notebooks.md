# Task 03 – Clean and annotate main notebooks

## Objective

Apply the defined structure and leave the main notebooks clean, runnable, and with minimal markdown explanations.

## Steps

- [ ] Rename/move notebooks according to the structure defined in Task 02.
- [ ] For each main notebook:
  - [ ] Remove irrelevant test cells or duplicated results.
  - [ ] Ensure the notebook can be run from top to bottom without errors.
  - [ ] Add a markdown cell at the beginning with:
    - A clear title.
    - The notebook’s objective.
    - How it relates to the rest of the project.
- [ ] Optional: add small markdown sections to separate logical blocks (data loading, EDA, analysis, partial conclusions).

## Expected outcome

Main notebooks are in the right folder, with clear names, low noise, and enough context for a new reader to understand what they are looking at.
