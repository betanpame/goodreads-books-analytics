# Task 02 – Define notebooks structure and naming

## Objective

Design a folder structure and consistent naming scheme for notebooks, aligned with the overall project overview and Phase 06.

## Steps

- [ ] Decide the main folder for notebooks (for example `notebooks/`).
- [ ] Define 2–4 **main** notebooks that you want a reader to go through, for example:
  - `01_eda_books.ipynb`
  - `02_analysis_and_visualizations.ipynb`
  - `03_sql_vs_pandas_comparison.ipynb` (optional)
- [ ] Decide what to do with secondary notebooks:
  - Move them to a subfolder such as `notebooks/archive/`?
  - Rename them to indicate they are experiments?
- [ ] Write down these decisions in a small notes file (for example `docs/notebooks-structure.md`) to document your criteria.

## Expected outcome

A concrete proposal for notebook structure and standardized names, ready to apply in the next task.
