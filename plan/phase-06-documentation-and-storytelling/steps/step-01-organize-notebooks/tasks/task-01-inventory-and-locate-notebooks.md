# Task 01 – Inventory and locate existing notebooks

## Objective

Have a clear inventory of all notebooks relevant to the project (EDA, analysis, SQL vs pandas comparison, other experiments) and know where they currently live.

## Steps

- [ ] Search the repository for all `*.ipynb` files.
- [ ] Classify each notebook according to its main purpose (initial EDA, main analysis, SQL vs pandas, experiments, etc.).
- [ ] Record in a simple table (for example under `plan/` or `docs/`) a list of notebooks with:
  - Current file name.
  - Current folder.
  - Type/purpose.
- [ ] Identify notebooks that are clearly obsolete or duplicated so you can decide whether to archive or delete them later.

## Expected outcome

A clear list of existing notebooks and their role, which will be the basis for renaming and reorganizing in the next tasks.
