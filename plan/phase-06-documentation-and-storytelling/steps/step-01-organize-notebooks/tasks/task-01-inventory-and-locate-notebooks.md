# Task 01 – Inventory and locate existing analysis scripts

## Objective

Have a clear inventory of all analysis scripts relevant to the project (EDA, analysis, SQL vs pandas comparison, other experiments) and know where they currently live.

## Steps

- [ ] Search the repository for all `*.py` files.
- [ ] Classify each analysis script according to its main purpose (initial EDA, main analysis, SQL vs pandas, experiments, etc.).
- [ ] Record in a simple table (for example under `plan/` or `docs/`) a list of analysis scripts with:
  - Current file name.
  - Current folder.
  - Type/purpose.
- [ ] Identify analysis scripts that are clearly obsolete or duplicated so you can decide whether to archive or delete them later.

## Expected outcome

A clear list of existing analysis scripts and their role, which will be the basis for renaming and reorganizing in the next tasks.
