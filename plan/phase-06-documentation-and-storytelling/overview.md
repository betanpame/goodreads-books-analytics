# Phase 06 – Documentation and Storytelling

## Goal

Transform your work into a **clear, professional story** that can be understood by non-technical stakeholders and showcased in your portfolio.

In this phase you will practice **data storytelling**:

- Explaining _why_ you did each step, not only _what_ you did.
- Turning technical results (tables, charts, queries) into plain-language insights.
- Organizing your repository so that a new reader can follow the project end to end.

## Inputs

- All previous phases substantially completed.
- Notebooks with EDA and analysis.
- SQL scripts and Docker setup in place or in progress.

## Outputs / Deliverables

1. A polished **root README.md** that includes:
   - Project overview and motivation.
   - Dataset description.
   - High-level architecture (Python, PostgreSQL, Docker).
   - How to run the project locally (and later in the cloud).
   - Summary of key findings with example charts.
2. Organized **notebooks**:
   - Clear naming and ordering.
   - Minimal duplication.
   - Explanatory markdown cells.
3. A short **written report or presentation outline** summarizing:
   - Business questions.
   - Approach.
   - Key insights and recommendations.

## Steps in This Phase

5. **Step 5 – Prepare Sharing and Next Notes**

## Tips

- Think of this phase as preparing to show your work to a hiring manager or a client.
- Avoid jargon when possible; explain technical terms briefly when you use them.
- Include 2–3 key charts directly in the README or include links/screenshots.
- Ask yourself: "If I came to this repository for the first time, could I understand what the project does and what the main findings are in 5–10 minutes?" If not, improve the structure or explanations.
