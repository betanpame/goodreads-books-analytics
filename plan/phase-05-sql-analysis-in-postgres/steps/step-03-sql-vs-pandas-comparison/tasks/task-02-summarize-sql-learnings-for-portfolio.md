## Task 02 – Summarize SQL Learnings for Portfolio

### Objective
Create a **short write-up** that highlights your SQL skills and how they complement your Python/pandas work, suitable for inclusion in your portfolio or README.

### Inputs
- Completed SQL scripts from Step 02.
- Notes from Task 01 about SQL vs pandas.

### Outputs / Deliverables
- A markdown section (e.g., in `README.md` or `docs/sql-summary.md`) summarizing:  
  - What types of questions you answered with SQL.  
  - Key SQL features you practiced (GROUP BY, HAVING, window functions, etc.).  
  - How SQL and pandas analyses support each other.

### Suggested Steps
1. **List key SQL accomplishments**  
   - Examples:  
     - "Implemented top-N author and book rankings using GROUP BY and ORDER BY."  
     - "Explored publication trends using aggregations by year."  
     - "Used window functions to compute top books per author and rolling averages.".

2. **Draft a narrative paragraph or two**  
   - Explain how you moved from pandas analyses to SQL.  
   - Emphasize what you learned about thinking in SQL.

3. **Add a bullet list of SQL capabilities**  
   - Example bullets:  
     - Aggregations and grouping for summary metrics.  
     - Filtering with WHERE and HAVING.  
     - Ordering and limiting results for rankings.  
     - Using window functions for advanced analysis.

4. **Link to assets**  
   - Reference the `sql/` folder and example files.  
   - Optionally, link to the comparison notebook.

5. **Review and polish**  
   - Ensure the text is concise and clear.  
   - Imagine a recruiter or hiring manager reading this section.

- [ ] Key SQL accomplishments listed.  
- [ ] Narrative paragraphs about SQL experience written.
