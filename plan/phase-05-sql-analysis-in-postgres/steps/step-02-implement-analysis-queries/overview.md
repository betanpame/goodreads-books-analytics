# Step 02 – Implement Core Analysis Queries

In this step you will translate your main business questions and metrics into **SQL queries**.

You will:

- Write modular, well-commented SQL scripts for each type of analysis.
- Use aggregations, filtering, and ordering to compute key metrics.
- Optionally, practice joins and window functions.

Work through the tasks in the `tasks/` folder in order.
