# Task 02 – Define Main Books Table

## Objective

Design the SQL definition for the main `books` table in PostgreSQL.

## Instructions

1. Using your type mapping, write a draft `CREATE TABLE` statement for a table named `books`.
2. Include at minimum:
   - `book_id` (or `bookID`) as a primary key.
   - All other relevant columns with appropriate types.
3. Consider adding basic constraints where appropriate, such as:
   - `NOT NULL` for columns that should always be present.
   - Default values if they make sense.
4. Save this DDL statement in a SQL file, for example: `sql/create_books_table.sql`.
5. Add comments in the SQL file explaining any design decisions.

## Checklist

- [ ] I have written a `CREATE TABLE books` statement.
- [ ] I have saved it in a `.sql` file under a `sql/` folder.
- [ ] I have documented key decisions in comments.

## Result

You have a concrete table definition that can be executed in PostgreSQL.
