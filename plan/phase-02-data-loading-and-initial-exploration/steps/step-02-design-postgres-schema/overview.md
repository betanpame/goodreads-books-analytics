# Step 02 – Design PostgreSQL Schema

## Goal

Design a **simple, analysis-friendly schema** in PostgreSQL for storing the Goodreads Books dataset.

## Why This Step Matters

A clear schema allows you to:
- Run SQL analysis efficiently.
- Potentially expand the project later with more related tables (e.g. authors, publishers).

At this stage you will keep the design simple (one main table), while taking note of opportunities for normalization.

## Tasks

Detailed tasks are in the `tasks/` folder:

1. `task-01-map-columns-to-sql-types.md`
2. `task-02-define-main-books-table.md`
3. `task-03-consider-future-normalization.md`
