# Task 01 – Prepare Books Table in PostgreSQL

## Objective

Create the `books` table in your PostgreSQL database using the DDL you designed.

## Instructions

1. Ensure your PostgreSQL Docker container is running.
2. Connect to the database using your preferred method:
   - `psql` inside the container.
   - A database client (DBeaver, pgAdmin, VS Code extension).
3. Run the `CREATE TABLE` statement from `sql/create_books_table.sql`.
4. Verify that the table now exists (e.g., with `\d books` in `psql` or via your GUI client).

## Checklist

- [ ] The PostgreSQL container is running.
- [ ] I have executed the `CREATE TABLE books` statement.
- [ ] I have confirmed that the table exists.

## Result

Your database has a table ready to receive data from `books.csv`.
