# Step 03 – Load Data into PostgreSQL

## Goal

Implement a repeatable process to load `books.csv` into your PostgreSQL database.

## Why This Step Matters

Having the dataset inside PostgreSQL will let you:
- Practice SQL queries on real data.
- Compare SQL-based and pandas-based analysis.
- Prepare for more advanced data engineering projects later.

## Tasks

Detailed tasks are in the `tasks/` folder:

1. `task-01-prepare-books-table-in-postgres.md`
2. `task-02-load-data-from-csv-to-postgres.md`
3. `task-03-verify-row-counts-and-samples.md`
