# Step 01 – Inspect Dataset with pandas

## Goal

Load the Goodreads Books dataset into pandas and perform a structured **first-pass inspection** of the data.

## Why This Step Matters

Before designing tables or complex analysis, you need a clear picture of:
- What each column contains.
- Basic ranges and distributions.
- Potential parsing issues (e.g. dates, numeric vs text, multiple authors).

## Tasks

Detailed tasks are in the `tasks/` folder:

1. `task-01-create-initial-eda-analysis script.md`
2. `task-02-load-csv-and-basic-summary.md`
3. `task-03-explore-key-columns-and-types.md`

These tasks will give you a solid understanding of the raw dataset.
