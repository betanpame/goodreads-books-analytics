# Task 01 – Create Initial EDA Notebook

## Objective

Create a Jupyter notebook that will serve as the starting point for your exploratory work on the Goodreads Books dataset.

## Instructions

1. Start your Python + Jupyter Docker container (from Phase 01).
2. In the Jupyter file browser, navigate to the `notebooks/` folder of this repository (create it if it does not exist).
3. Create a new notebook named, for example, `01_initial_inspection_books.ipynb`.
4. In the first cells of the notebook, add markdown explaining:
   - The purpose of the notebook (initial inspection of `books.csv`).
   - A short description of the dataset (what each row represents).
5. Save the notebook.

## Checklist

- [ ] The `notebooks/` folder exists at the project root.
- [ ] I have created `01_initial_inspection_books.ipynb`.
- [ ] The notebook contains an introductory markdown cell.

## Result

You now have a dedicated notebook to use for initial exploration with pandas.
